Bootstrap an NFT minting site with merkle tree whitelists.


Go to [nft-merkle-whitelist.vercel.app](https://nft-merkle-whitelist.vercel.app/) to see the latest deployment.

Deployed sample NFT contract can be viewed on [rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0E7121b8aaEBd6F4fAbe13890E33d9E8fD0Fd345](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x0E7121b8aaEBd6F4fAbe13890E33d9E8fD0Fd345#code)

## Get Started
Play around with the deployed test app [here](https://nft-merkle-whitelist.vercel.app/)

To build your own NFT mint page with merkle whitelist:
1. Clone this repo
2. Head to [contracts](https://github.com/straightupjac/nft-merkle-whitelist-scaffold/tree/main/contracts) `README.md` to set up your contracts
3. Head to [web](https://github.com/straightupjac/nft-merkle-whitelist-scaffold/tree/main/web) `README.md` to set up your front-end
4. Deploy your web-app using vercel

## Inspiration
Inspiration for this came from many different projects. Some notable ones include:
- [Scaffold-eth buyer-mints](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/tree/buyer-mints-nft) - a more complex version of this project :) I learned a ton from this example!
- Anish Agnihotri's [ERC20 merkle airdrop scaffold](https://github.com/Anish-Agnihotri/merkle-airdrop-starter) - focused on ERC20 airdrops but similar Merkle Tree validation logic
- Medium article on [Using Merkle Trees for NFT Whitelists](https://medium.com/@ItsCuzzo/using-merkle-trees-for-nft-whitelists-523b58ada3f9) by Alan, super helpful article to better understand Merkle Trees
- https://www.721.so/ - haven't personally tested it, but looks like another awesome resource
- Most of the front-end web3 tooling is built on top of [`web3-react`](https://github.com/NoahZinsmeister/web3-react) - check out this library if you're building your own web3 UIs
- Lots of inspiration taken from the [Crypto Coven contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5180db8f5c931aae63c74266b211f580155ecac8#contracts) as well - they used Merkle Trees for their community and gift mints
